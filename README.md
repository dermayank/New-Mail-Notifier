# New-Mail-Notifier
A python code that will notify you whenever you have received a new email.

It uses two methods of retrieving mails:
  1) IMAP Protocol
  2) Google Inbox feed feature

# Usage 
  After downloading the code execute following command on terminal:
         
             $python recent_mail.py
          
# Limitation
  Currently the code had been  tested only on Linux(Ubuntu) Platform. I am not sure about its behaviour in Windows or Mac Platform.
